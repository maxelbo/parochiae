# Parochi√¶ - Local Parish Finder

I'm working on this app that searchs for local parishes using the Foursquare API. For the images, I'm using the Unsplash API. The app is built with Next.js and uses Airtable as the database.

Visit [https://parochiae.vercel.app/](https://parochiae.vercel.app/) to use it.
